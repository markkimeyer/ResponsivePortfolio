# ResponsivePortfolio
My responsive portfolio

This responsive portfolio has three pages: About, Gallery, and Contact. Each page has a consistent navbar with working links that navegate between these 3 pages. A sticky footer is on each page as well and has working links to personal linked-in and github pages. The portfolio utilizes bootstrap's grid system instead of CSS media queries to provide a responsive layout that optimizes the layout depending on which device is viewing the page. 

The About Me page has a responsive image and several paragraphs of text. It uses bootstrap's grid system, paragraph tags, a special google font, and has a second header with Costa Rica's slogan, "Pura Vida," or "Pure Life."

The Gallery page uses bootstrap card components which have a responsive layout when the page size is reduced. These cards have placeholder images that will be replaced by future completed projects. I really liked the card component instead of just a placeholder image because it provides addiitonal formatting for a title and description of each image.  

The Contact page uses a bootstrap form with text fields for Name and Message and an Email field which recognizes email addresses. There is also a submit button. Additionally, the background of the form container is intenionally missing to allow a seamless background image. Please note, this form is not yet functional.
